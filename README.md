# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview â€“ Church Attendance App

This is an offline-first mobile/web application designed to manage Sunday attendance lists for a local church. The goal is to provide a lightweight, intuitive and reliable way to track member attendance even without internet access.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- Offline-First Functionality: The app works seamlessly without internet connectivity. All data is stored locally and persists between sessions.

- Main "Lists" Screen: The home screen displays all created Sunday attendance lists. Each list represents a specific Sunday.

- Add New Sundays: Easily add new attendance lists for each Sunday.

- Attendance View: Tapping on a Sunday opens the full list of church members.

- You can tap each member to mark them as "present".

- The list allows for quick toggling and visual feedback.

- Attendance Summary: At the top of each list, the app displays the total number of attendees for that Sunday.

### ðŸ§± Use Case

This tool is built specifically for church leaders and administrators who need a simple and efficient way to take attendance every week, even in rural or limited-connectivity environments.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
